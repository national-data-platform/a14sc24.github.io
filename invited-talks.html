        <h1>Title: AI and Scientific Discovery</h1>
        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The integration of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly foundation models in language and vision, is revolutionizing scientific discovery. AI methods are transforming research by facilitating hypothesis generation, experiment design, data analysis, and interpretation, enabling breakthroughs across diverse fields such as genetics and climate modeling.</p>
        <p>This talk explores recent applications of AI tools and models that are reshaping the scientific process across various fields ranging from genetics to climate modeling. In this context, we discuss AI methods ranging from self-supervised learning, which allows models to be trained on vast amounts of unlabelled data, to generative methods that can synthesize hypotheses by analyzing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. While these advancements offer significant enhancements, we will also address ongoing challenges and also aim to discuss the algorithmic innovations necessary to further accelerate scientific progress with AI.</p>
