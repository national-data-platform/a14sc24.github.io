        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In an era when the boundaries of science and technology are increasingly overlapping, the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has marked a pivotal shift in scientific communication. These cutting-edge technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance the dissemination of complex scientific knowledge, making it more accessible and understandable to diverse stakeholders. This workshop will explore how generative AI can promote Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles while upholding equity and inclusivity in scientific discourse.</p>
