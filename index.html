        <p>In an era when the boundaries of science and technology are increasingly overlapping, the emergence of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has marked a pivotal shift in scientific communication. These cutting-edge technologies offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance the dissemination of complex scientific knowledge, making it more accessible and understandable to diverse stakeholders. However, the rapid integration of generative AI into the fabric of science communication also poses significant challenges, notably in maintaining the diversity of perspectives and addressing potential biases inherent in AI-driven content. This is happening at a critical time for the scientific community, when scientists are exploring how generative AI, knowledge graphs, and large language models can revolutionize the sharing and understanding of scientific ideas across different communities. To explore such integration of science communication and AI, this workshop will bring together scientists, technologists, ethicists, AI developers, and science communicators to explore how generative AI can promote Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles while upholding equity and inclusivity in scientific discourse. ⁤⁤We will critically examine how AI can advance FAIR principles in scientific domains, technology, computations, and data. ⁤Our goal is to cultivate a deep understanding of the advantages and challenges of LLM technologies, thereby aiding in creating robust frameworks and practices that promote the positive impact of generative AI in enhancing science communication and research innovation. This initiative is congruent with the overarching aim of amplifying public engagement with science, highlighting ethical and equitable imperatives in applying AI technologies within the scientific ambit.</p>
